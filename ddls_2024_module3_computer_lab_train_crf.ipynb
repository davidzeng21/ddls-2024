        "\n",
        "### 🦠 Microbial Secondary Metabolites and Their Impact on Human Health\n",
        "\n",
        "Microbes are capable of producing a wide array of **secondary metabolites**, which allow them to interact with each other, as well as with their environment more generally. Secondary metabolites aren't directly involved in the growth, development, or reproduction of the microbes that produce them; however, these compounds allow microbes to respond to stressors and stimuli in their environment, giving them a selective advantage over other microbes in their ecological niche.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond their ecological functions, microbial secondary metabolites play important roles in human health. Some secondary metabolites, for example, are toxic to humans (e.g., [colibactin](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2080-8), a genotoxic secondary metabolite produced by *Escherichia coli* and other Enterobacteriaceae, which has been linked to colorectal cancer; [cereulide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500953/), a toxin produced by some *Bacillus cereus* group strains, which is a leading cause of foodborne illness; [aflatoxins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814623023932?via%3Dihub), which are carcinogenic, immunosuppressive, genotoxic, and mutagenic mycotoxins produced primarily by *Aspergillus* spp.). Other secondary metabolites, however, have important uses in medicine and industry (e.g., [antibiotics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-021-00313-1), such as penicillin, streptomycin, fosfomycin, bacitracin, clavulanic acid; [anticancer drugs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41417-023-00715-x), such as bleomycin and mitomycin C).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, regardless of whether they're really good or really bad for human helth...**we have a big incentive to discover novel microbial secondary metabolites!**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🥊 Machine Learning for Discovering Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs)\n",
        "\n",
        "Until recently, microbial secondary metabolite discovery was costly and low-throughput. However, as [the number of publicly available microbial genomes explodes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779008/), we can now mine microbial (meta)genomes for the genomic determinants of secondary metabolism! Specifically, bioinformatic tools for novel secondary metabolite discovery make use of a simple observation: that the enzymatic machinery responsible for microbial secondary metabolism is encoded by physically clustered groups of genes called **biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)**. Thus, by mining microbial (meta)genomes for novel BGCs, we can hopefully find novel secondary metabolites.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most popular BGC mining methods are [rule-based approaches](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/W1/W46/7151336), which use hard-coded, manually curated sets of \"rules\" to determine if a BGC is present in a microbial genome or not. However, in recent years, [machine learning (ML) approaches](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-023-00774-7) have been growing in popularity. ML BGC discovery methods assume that certain genomic features (specifically, protein domains) occur inside of a BGC more frequently than outside of it (and vice versa). Based on this assumption, a model is trained to \"learn\" different protein domain patterns associated with BGC presence/absence from a training data set. The trained model can then be used to detect BGCs in a query genome by calculating the probability that a particular gene or protein domain is part of a BGC or not; genomic regions that surpass a specified BGC probability threshold are predicted to be BGCs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 Let it RiPP! Training a CRF for RiPP detection\n",
        "\n",
        "[A range of ML models have been trained to detect BGCs in microbial genomes.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-023-00774-7) One such model is the [**conditional random field (CRF)**](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/6772/papers/crf.pdf). CRFs are a type of discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model; they have been used in the natural language processing (NLP) space for years. [Not only are CRFs fast and easy to train, but they are \"white-box\" models](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.03.442509v1), meaning that we can use model introspection to look \"under the hood\" and figure out exactly what they're learning!\n",
        "\n",
        "In this activity, we are going to train a CRF to detect BGCs associated with the production of [**ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3954855/), a special subclass of BGCs. Specifically, we are going to re-train [GECCO](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.03.442509v1), a CRF-based BGC discovery tool, on a set of bacterial genomes, each of which contains one or more known, experimentally validated RiPPs. We will then evaluate the performance of our model on a test set to see how well it performs on novel data it has never seen before. Finally, we will look \"under the hood\" to see exactly what our CRF is learning.\n",

        "Description: Lantibiotics are antibiotic peptides that include rare thioether amino acids, such as lanthionine or methyl-lanthionine. These peptides are produced by Gram-positive bacteria and are encoded by precursor peptides that undergo post-translational modification to form the mature, active lantibiotic.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Type-A lantibiotics are flexible and amphiphilic.\n",
        "* They function by creating pores in bacterial membranes, often interacting with specific molecules like lipid II, a membrane precursor.\n",
        "\n",
        "PF04604 seems like an important domain for RiPP detection, and here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. RiPPs (Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-translationally Modified Peptides) undergo significant post-translational modifications to achieve their final functional form. The lantibiotic family fits this description well.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Type-A lantibiotics are produced via ribosomal synthesis, which directly links them to the RiPP class of compounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Since lantibiotics exhibit antimicrobial activity and are gene-encoded, detecting this domain could help identify bacterial genomes that are involved in producing these bioactive compounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, PF04604 is highly relevant to RiPP detection because lantibiotics are an established subclass of RiPPs, and this domain’s presence indicates a key component in the biosynthesis of these peptides.\n",
