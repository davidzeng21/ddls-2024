        "  Parts of the Protocol That Can Be Automated with the Opentrons Robot:\n",
        "    Aspirating medium and washing plates with PBS: After biofilm formation, careful aspiration of medium followed by PBS washes can also be handled with the Opentrons, with the right speed and volume settings to avoid disrupting biofilms. This may also require some fine-tuning based on experimental conditions, but it is a common automation task.\n",
        "  Parts That Could Be Automated with More Advanced Robotic Hardware:\n",
        "    Centrifugation and Cell Washing (Step 1):    The steps involving centrifugation and washing cells can be partially automated using robotic centrifuges or liquid-handling stations integrated with robotic arms for tube handling. However, the Opentrons itself would need to be integrated with such external hardware, as it doesn't handle centrifugation or vortexing directly.\n",
        "    Mixing Cells and Counting: Automated systems for cell counting (e.g., integrated cell counters or imaging systems) could be used to automate the cell counting step before plating. However, this would require additional hardware beyond the standard Opentrons Flex configuration.\n",
        "    Incubation with Controlled Conditions (Step 2): While the Opentrons can automate the liquid handling steps, incubating plates at specific temperatures and times could be managed by advanced robotic systems that integrate plate handling and incubation tasks. Some systems have robotic incubators that automatically take plates in and out.\n",
        "  Parts That Are Difficult to Automate Reliably:\n",
        "    Aseptic Techniques for Handling Cultures (Step 1): While basic liquid handling steps can be automated, ensuring aseptic conditions, particularly when handling live cultures, remains challenging. Robotic systems often struggle with maintaining sterile environments unless they are housed in a controlled environment such as a biosafety cabinet. Human oversight is still critical for aseptic techniques.\n",
        "    Visual Inspection of Biofilm Formation: While automation could theoretically handle a lot of liquid handling and even imaging, confirming biofilm formation by visual inspection (e.g., using an inverted microscope) still requires human judgment for quality control, especially when determining the extent of biofilm formation.\n",
        "    Handling Fragile Biofilms: Biofilms can be fragile and sensitive to disruption during medium exchanges. Automating these steps without disrupting the biofilm can be tricky, and a gentle approach would be necessary. Some advanced systems may be able to do this, but careful calibration and validation would be required.\n",
        "3.  \n",
        "    Generate Initial Protocol: The LLM creates an initial protocol based on inputs like the lab hardware, reagents, and the desired outcome.\n",
        "    Simulate and Analyze: The Opentrons simulator runs the protocol and generates logs.\n",
        "    Feedback Loop: The LLM reads the simulation logs and adjusts the protocol, flagging errors like pipette mismatches, calibration issues, or unexpected volumes.\n",
        "    Re-run Simulations: Once corrections are applied, the revised protocol is re-simulated to check for further improvements.\n",
        "    Iterative Revision: This process continues until the protocol runs error-free and meets predefined performance criteria.\n",
